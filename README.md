    .package(url: "https://github.com/beamo-co/breeze-swift.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

2. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/beamo-co/breeze-swift.git`
3. Select the version you want to use
4. Click Add Package


## Usage

### Initialization

First, import the SDK and initialize it in your app:

```swift
import Breeze

// In your AppDelegate or main app file
@main
struct exampleApp: App {
    init() {
        //1) Initialize app using shared singleton Breeze instance
        Breeze.shared.configure(with: BreezeConfiguration(
            apiKey: "API_KEY", //breeze client API Key
            appScheme: "testapp://", //your deeplink app scheme or universal link
            //optional
            userId: "" //unique user ID as identifier who made the purchae
        ))
    }
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
            //2) add redirection listener
            .onOpenURL { url in
                Breeze.shared.verifyUrl(url)
            }
        }
    }
}
```


#### Configuring App URL Scheme

To enable deep linking in your app, you need to configure a custom URL scheme:

1. Open your Xcode project
2. Select your target
3. Go to the "Info" tab
4. Expand "URL Types"
5. Click the "+" button to add a new URL type
6. In the "URL Schemes" field, enter your app's scheme (e.g., "testapp")
7. The full URL scheme will be "testapp://"

![URL Scheme Configuration](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app/url-scheme-configuration.png)

This URL scheme should match the `appScheme` parameter you provide when configuring Breeze


### Get Products

```swift
let breezeProducts = try await Breeze.shared.products(["IAP_PRODUCT_ID"])

//OR if you have existing storekit Product
let breezeProduct = try await Breeze.shared.fromSkProduct(skProduct: product)
```

### Making a Purchase

```swift
// Example of purchasing a product from storekit Product
 func purchaseWeb(_ product: Product) async throws {
    let breezeProduct = try await Breeze.shared.fromSkProduct(skProduct: product)

    try await breezeProduct.purchase(using: Breeze.shared, onSuccess: { transaction in
        //YOUR LOGIC on success purchase
        Task {
            await transaction.finish(using: Breeze.shared) //always finish transaction
        }
    })
}
```
